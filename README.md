AI Agent Audit Toolkit
An audit framework for AI systems implementing ISACA AI Audit Toolkit and NIST AI Risk Management Framework methodologies.

Overview
The AI Agent Audit Toolkit provides a structured approach to AI compliance and control assessment designed for AI developers, IT auditors, and compliance professionals. This toolkit integrates multiple established frameworks to provide comprehensive AI system auditing capabilities.

Key Features
Multi-Framework Support: Implements ISACA AI Audit Toolkit and NIST AI 600-1 GAI Risk Management Framework
20 Control Families: Comprehensive coverage including Adversarial Defense, AI Bias Mitigation, Data Privacy, and Model Governance
12 GAI Risk Categories: Complete NIST risk assessment including CBRN Information, Confabulation, and Data Privacy risks
6 Explainability Dimensions: Rationale, Responsibility, Data, Fairness, Safety & Performance, and Impact assessments
Automated Assessment Engine: Real-time evidence collection and compliance evaluation
Regulatory Compliance: Support for EU AI Act, NIST 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001, and other frameworks
Continuous Monitoring: Real-time risk monitoring with automated alerting
Enterprise Integration: APIs for integration with existing AI/ML platforms and security tools
Architecture
The toolkit is built using:

Java 17+ with Spring Boot 3.5+ framework
Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
